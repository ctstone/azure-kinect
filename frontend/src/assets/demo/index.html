    <h3><u>About the Project</u></h3>
    <p>With over 40 brick and mortar and pop up locations across the United States and Mexico GiGi’s Playhouse is the
      ONLY network of Down Syndrome Achievement Centers. Every day, they provide FREE, life-changing therapeutic,
      educational and career training programs for 30,000+ individuals of all ages.</p>
    <p>Down syndrome is the largest chromosomal disability in our country and yet, it is the least funded. From a
      prenatal diagnosis to career skills, we make a lifetime commitment to remain by their side. Families are empowered
      with all the tools their child needs to succeed!</p>
    <p>GiGiFIT programs combine physical therapy with a strong fitness focus and an ultimate goal of success and
      improved movement. GiGiFIT was created in collaboration with by skilled Physical Therapists who work specifically
      with individuals with Down syndrome. The GiGiFIT programs are designed to address common issues for individuals
      with Down syndrome including hypotonia, excessive joint laxity, and decreased balance. Every GiGiFIT program is
      safe, effective, and progressive. GiGiFIT helps participants build strength, endurance, power, joint stability,
      balance, and movement control. GiGiFIT empowers participants to be more independent and confident in their
      abilities while improving their overall health and wellness.</p>
    <p>The goal of this hack is build a virtual coach for this segment focused on 4 exercises (squat, push up, planks,
      bridge) out of 12 to start with that will have the following business benefits.
      <ul>
        <li>AI can measure the effectiveness of exercise at individual patient level and score/provide feedback that
          they cannot do today.</li>
        <li>There are a limited number of coach for particular coaching method. This is a way to augment these physical
          therapists.</li>
        <li>This also provides consistency in exercise routines. Participants workout 3 days a week in the playhouse.
          This technology be used for people to exercise at home.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For GiGi's expansion initiative, Gigi would like to put this course out in public, collect telemetry and
        feedback on use so they can understand the best place to open next center. A small team from Microsoft is
        already in conversation with GiGi and are passionate about getting this solution out to Gigi and the
        participants.</p>
